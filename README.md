# Income-Calculator
The simple yearly and hourly income calculator will quickly do the math and break down different increments of time for your pay.

Simply put in a value like 18 or 35 etc. to get a yearly breakdown of hourly pay and put in something like 35000 or 55000 to get a breakdown of yearly pay down to hourly increments. For hourly it will count up; Hourly, weekly, monthly and yearly (it will also ask you how many hours you're working) while putting in a value like 35000 will break down your pay in decending increments; monthly, weekly, hourly.
The program will complete without errors if you put in letters instead of numbers. I haven't placed an error message asking for integers if you do this, it just completes as 0.
